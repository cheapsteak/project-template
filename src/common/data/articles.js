    title: 'Middle School Choice',

    content: `<p id="above-fold">All of our middle schools offer the same rigorous curriculum and provide scholars with an excellent education. But some students have to commute long distances to get to their middle schools. Additionally, some parents prefer their children attend school closer to where they work so they can more easily attend student events. Our middle school choice process allows families the chance to have their scholar attend a more conveniently located middle school.</p>
              <p>In addition to convenience, we think it is important for scholars to have an opportunity to socialize with different children. With middle school choice, kids are able to go to a school with new classmates to make new friends.</p>
              <p>All rising 5th grade families fill out a middle school preference form, ranking their choices of middle schools for the upcoming year. Scholars stay in the same middle school all four years. Scholars are matched to a middle school based on their choices and the number of seats available. Priority is given to scholars with older siblings currently enrolled in the selected middle school and those who live closest to the middle school. Every scholar is guaranteed a seat in a Success Academy middle school, and about 90% of families are matched with their first or second choice of schools.</p>`

    title: 'Special Needs Students at Success Academy',
    content: `<p id="above-fold">Success Academy has a strong commitment to serving children with special education needs. We devote many resources to educating students who have been identified for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs): hiring special education teachers and school psychologists, offering Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes in most grades, and providing 12:1:1 classes (12 students, two adults) in schools where we have sufficient space.</p><p>We also provide extra support to scholars who need it by enrolling them in an Academic Elective course for an academic quarter. In this course, they receive high-quality academic intervention in math, literacy, or both. Academic Elective teachers regularly communicate with advisors about scholars’ progress. Here, our most vulnerable scholars develop the skills they need to be successful in a whole-class environment; regain confidence in their abilities as mathematicians, readers, and critical thinkers; and remember what it is that makes learning exciting!</p><p>With our programming, special needs scholars in our schools achieve at a high level:</p><ul><li>During the 2013-14 school year, Success Academy “graduated” or declassified 13% of its special needs scholars from their IEPs.</li>
              <li>On the most recent state exams, more than 11% of all Success Academy test-takers were children with special needs, and 82% of them passed math (compared to 11.4% of citywide special needs students) and 33% passed English (compared to 6.7% citywide).
              <li>Students with disabilities at Success Academy outperformed the NYC average for all students in ELA (33% vs. 29%), and they were nearly twice as likely to pass math as New York State’s students without disabilities (82% vs. 41%).</li></ul>`,
