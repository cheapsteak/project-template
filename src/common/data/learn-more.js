          ` <p>When founder Eva Moskowitz opened Success Academy Harlem 1 with 165 students in 2006, she had a vision for a school that would banish boredom and challenge young minds. Her mission was twofold: to build exceptional, world-class public schools—engaging, academically rigorous, economically efficient houses of learning—to prove that children from all backgrounds can thrive in a truly great school. But equally important, she envisioned Success Academy as a catalyst for other education reform initiatives across the country, transforming the public policies that deny so many children access to the American dream.</p>
            <p>Today our network is comprised of 41 schools, serving more than 15,000 children, primarily from New York City’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Success Academy believes in setting high expectations for children and employs a curriculum and teaching practice that develop critical thinking, reading, writing, and math skills, while sparking in children the joy of discovery and a love of learning and developing the whole child. Scholars participate in sports, learn chess, and develop their talents in dance, music, and the visual arts. We are raising the bar and redefining what is possible in public education every day.</p>
            <p>As part of our mission, we feel it is our obligation to share our school design with parents and educators to make the biggest impact possible for children and families. Starting with our elementary schools, we launched an online virtual tour (write link) to provide an in-depth look at our mission, curriculum, pedagogy, and culture. Here, we offer the same with our nine middle schools (generally, grades 5-7). Visitors can experience our school design through the eyes of our middle school scholars, while exclusive documentary video, photos, and articles showcase what makes Success Academy the standard bearers for excellence in education.</p>
            <p>We are committed to sharing our innovative, efficient model and methods with parents and educators across the country. To learn more about Success Academy, please visit our <a href="http://www.successacademies.org/" target="__blank">website</a>.</p>
